As a web dev. Often happens to do same redundant tasks from time to time.
One of withc ist test  server setups, or local environtment setups.
This scirpt should solve web project creation problem for test server
Basicaly the scenario is same for new  web project
1. create user
2. crate home dirs
3. add configs web servers
4. create database

so the task for this shell script is to do atleast part of the job
